    A qualitative, high-level map that defines the scope of an improvement project by identifying **S**uppliers, **I**nputs, **P**rocess, **O**utputs, and **C**ustomers.

**Verdict & Hybrid Strategy:**
-   Use **SIPOC** to create the initial project charter and align stakeholders.
-   Use **NLP** on existing customer feedback data to validate the 'Outputs' and 'Customers' sections of the SIPOC and to quantify the business impact of different problems.
-   Use **Causal Discovery** outputs as a data-driven starting point for building more detailed process maps and identifying potential Xs for the Analyze phase.
