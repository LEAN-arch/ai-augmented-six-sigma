st.markdown("""
### 1. **Baseline with Classical Tools**
   - Use SPC and Capability Analysis to understand your current state. This provides the ground truth.
   - Use SIPOC and Process Maps to align stakeholders.

### 2. **Explore & Analyze with ML**
   - Feed historical data into ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to perform a wide-ranging analysis.
   - Use Feature Importance and SHAP to identify the previously unknown drivers of variation. This is your new, data-driven Fishbone diagram.

### 3. **Experiment & Optimize with Both**
   - Use the insights from ML to design a highly targeted classical DOE on the few most important variables. This is more efficient than a broad-based DOE.
   - For digital systems or simulations, use ML-based optimization (Bayesian Opt.) to explore the vast parameter space.

### 4. **Control with a Hybrid System**
   - Keep classical SPC charts on the final output (the CTQ) for simple, robust monitoring and compliance.
   - Deploy ML anomaly detection models on the input and process parameters (the Xs) to create an early warning system that predicts when the CTQ is *about to* go out of control.

This hybrid approach gives you the **interpretability and rigor** of Six Sigma combined with the **scalability and predictive power** of Machine Learning, creating a resilient, intelligent, and continuously improving quality system.
