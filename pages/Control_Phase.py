**Verdict & Hybrid Strategy:**
- **The Best of Both:** This is the most critical phase for a hybrid approach.
- **Monitor CTQs with SPC:** Keep classical control charts on your final, critical-to-quality (CTQ) outputs. They are simple, robust, and universally understood.
- **Monitor Inputs (Xs) with ML:** Deploy a multivariate ML anomaly detection model on the *input* and *process* parameters. This model acts as an **early warning system**. It will detect deviations in the inputs *before* they cause a defect in the output, allowing you to move from reactive to proactive control.
