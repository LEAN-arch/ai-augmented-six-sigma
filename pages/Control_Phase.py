- **Classical Control Chart (X-bar):** Monitors a single variable over time. Triggers an alarm when a point falls outside the +/- 3 sigma control limits. It's simple, robust, and effective for stable processes.
- **ML Anomaly Detection:** Learns the normal operating patterns of the system, including correlations between many variables. It can flag subtle deviations in the *pattern* of data that may be a precursor to a failure, even if no single variable has gone out of its classical limits.

**The Multivariate Trap that ML Solves:**
Imagine temperature and pressure are correlated. In a normal state, if temp goes up, pressure goes up.
- A classical system has two separate control charts.
- A failure mode causes temp to go up while pressure stays flat.
- Neither chart might signal a violation, as both values could be within their individual limits.
- An ML model trained on the *relationship* between variables would immediately flag this broken correlation as a major anomaly.
